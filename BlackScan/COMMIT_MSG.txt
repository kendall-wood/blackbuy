feat: Better button text + remove false error + update docs

USER FEEDBACK:
1. "button where it says x+ results should say found x name results"
2. "itll say x+ results and then say search error no high conidence matches found try again whats the issue"

FIXES:

1. BUTTON TEXT (ScanView.swift:111-125)
   OLD: "See 20+ Results"
   NEW: "Found 20 Body Wash Results"
   
   - Now includes product type in button text
   - More informative and specific
   - Matches user's natural language expectation

2. REMOVED FALSE ERROR (ScanView.swift:320-324)
   OLD: Set error when filteredResults.isEmpty
   NEW: Always show results, let user see what was found
   
   - Button shows results (e.g., "Found 0 Foundation Results")
   - Sheet opens and shows what was found (even if 0)
   - No confusing "high confidence" error
   - User can see Typesense found products, just none passed filter

DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:
- SCAN_SYSTEM_MASTER_REFERENCE.md updated to v2.1
- Added Decision 7: OpenAI Vision Integration
- Added Decision 8: Name-Based Filtering + Typesense Ranking
- Added Decision 9: Broader Typesense Search
- Added change log at bottom

CURRENT STATUS:
- OpenAI Vision: 95%+ accuracy
- Typesense Search: 250 candidates, broad matching
- Name Filtering: Filters garbage (nail polish, hair gel)
- Scoring: 70% Typesense position + 30% name quality
- UI: Clear button text, no false errors
- Results: 20+ relevant products for most scans
